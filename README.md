## Inspiration

Application idea was born during the online event called "React 10days challenge" witch was organized by eduweb.pl website. It was one of the project proposals that participants had to pick and develop within 10 days.

At the end of the event, first version of this app got very good reviews, which motivated me to keep improving it. Finally, after a few months of works, I think it's worth to show it to the world and You :)

## Main application requirements:

- add, delete and edit products that is their names, units, and current and minimum quantity
- amount of products should be easily seen and has easy to way to modify it
- when quantity of specific product will be lower than it's minimum, this item should be automatically added to the shopping list
- separate view for the shopping list, where you can also change products quantity and thus make them disappear from it

## Additional features

- product categories
- saving all data in the cloud (Firestore)
- responsibility
- settings view including:
  - dark mode
  - insert sample data
  - category manager where you can add and remove them
